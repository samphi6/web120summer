        <p>Lisa Marie is an artist from Covington, Ky. She started sharing her work in 2009 at local open mics. She has since won many poetry slams including: "Covington City Lights Slam" 2009, "Wild Women of Poetry Slam" hosted by The University of Kentucky 2016, and "Metaphorically Speaking Battle of Ohio" 2015 and 2016. She has released two albums of poetry titled, "Guilty of Truth" in 2010 and "Waking Up for Dreamers" in 2012. Lisa also has enjoyed sharing her work with young students encouraging them to share their passions, pains, and stories through poetry.</p>
        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
