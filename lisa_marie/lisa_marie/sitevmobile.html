    <h2 class="paper">BATTLE FOR THE VIEWPORTS!</h2>
        
    <section>
        
    <p>Before completely being swayed either way on which is preferable when choosing between a mobile app or designing a website with responsivity, I’m going to take a “wild” guess and place myself on team RW. The use of a mobile app seems to only hold full power when on a phone or tablet. Compared to a responsive website that would be designed for fluid navigation, I feel mobile apps are solely used on the go. With responsive design, the capabilities of a website owns a performance that promises boundlessness in a world of viewports.</p>
    <p>Thinkmobiles.com speculated a skyrocket of mobile users would grow from 4.01 to 5.07 billion from 2013 to 2019. According to statista.com, though the estimation is behind, 4.68 billion current mobile phone users in the world is still an impressive number. A website that is easily accessible without swimming through oodles of apps is easier for us to find exactly what we need, getting us exactly where we need to go without much effort. A responsive website is open to anyone, requiring no downloads or installation. As a developer for the internet, building a site mobile first creates a more malleable workspace in first designs and for future maintenance. The low cost of responsive design is unbeatable compared to a mobile app where we would have to create native apps for every type of phone or tablet.</p>
    <p>In a 2017 column, mobile app forward website Smashstack supports team MA with its functionality due to the fact the apps are typically built into the mobile devices OS, that would be otherwise difficult to support with web-based HTML-5. Smashstack also praises the brand recognition of a mobile app.</p>
    <p>“Nothing beats a native app for brand awareness and marketing. With handy desktop shortcuts, mobile apps put you front and center on each user’s phone, and the custom code used to create apps can relay information back to businesses about user behaviors to inform future development decisions.”</p><p><strong>—Smashstack/  The Pros and Cons of Mobile Apps vs. Responsive Web Design, 2017</strong></p>
    <p>The speed of a mobile app also seems to be a benefit amongst both Smashstack and Thinkbobiles, as they both agree since the app is designed top to bottom for efficiency, and the loading time beats the responsiveness of web design (Sometimes.)</p>
    <p>That said, I understand there are two ways on most roads, and even though I have not been convinced by my research, loyalty remains with team RW.</p>
