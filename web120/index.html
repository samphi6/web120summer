    <p>Drawn in by the idea of Chrysalis is something I latched onto with a death-grip at the moment of discovery. When I realized I was a Writer, an eye opened in the chest; immediately I submitted myself to this universe's eclectic spirit. Within this, I encountered the vast collections of marooned gods and goddesses charged with the same mad passion I am possessed by.</p> 
    <p>For years I've written beside an entity making this place beautiful. Enveloped in decades of unbreakable music, the savior of poetry, halls of suspended paints and portraiture, and the extraction of emotion from thin airâ€” forms of truth, rebellion and an indulgent independence claimed me as its own. In a fine effort to introduce the world to the company I've kept over some time, I started this thing to create a platform for the Artist by providing my hand in the styles of Web Development.</p>
